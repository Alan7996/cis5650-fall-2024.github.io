The University of Pennsylvania has [announced](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/announcements/message-community-about-penns-plans-fall-semester){:target="_blank"} its plans for the Fall 2020 semester. The University will be taking a hybrid approach to returning to campus, while all undergraduate students will be remote. As a result CIS 565 will be taught remotely using online teleconferencing tools.

The CIS Department, CG@Penn, and CIS 565 team are looking forward to providing the best experience for all our students. CIS 565 will remain true to its fundamentals to provide the best GPU Programming course, and will remain programming projects intensive with lectures to support those projects.

CIS 565 will be a synchronous course and will require students to attend live lectures if they are in a convenient time zone. CIS 565 is a highly interactive class and relies on student interaction to deliver the best learning experience. Recordings of lectures will be made available online for students who may not be able to attend live sessions due to time zone challenges.

For Fall 2020, we will be **enforcing a mandatory course prerequisite of CIS 460/560 or CIS 461/561**. If you have taken a similar computer graphics course, or have professional experience, we will consider that as a valid alternative. Please use the survey below to mark your qualification.

If you are interested in taking the course but do not have the prerequisites completed, please reach out to [Shehzan Mohammed](mailto:mza@seas.upenn.edu). We have to let you know that the course is very graphics and programming intensive and you will find it challenging without a graphics background, especially given that lectures and office hours will be remote.

If you have registered as a student for the course, or plan to, please complete this **required survey: [CIS 565 Fall 2020 Student Survey](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=DQSIkWdsW0yxEjajBLZtrQAAAAAAAAAAAAMAALDIch9UNFhVQ1hTREZEWUIzVkpDUk83VkNPVU5MRy4u){:target="_blank"}**.
