## Course Description

A timeline section from the following topics:

* **GPU Computing**: GPU architecture, massively parallel programming, parallel algorithms, performance.
* **Rendering**: Graphics pipeline (rasterization), path tracing, deferred shading, forward+ rendering, VR.
* **APIs**: CUDA, WebGL, RTX, Vulkan.

This is a project-intensive course with significant coding, writing, and presenting. It is **more work** than any other course, but it is worth it.

For a course more focused on GPU architecture without graphics, see Joe Devietti's [CIS 601](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~devietti/classes/cis601-spring2017/){:target="_blank"} (no longer offered at Penn).

## COVID-19 and Plans for Fall 2020 Semester

The University of Pennsylvania has [announced](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/announcements/message-community-about-penns-plans-fall-semester){:target="_blank"} its plans for the Fall 2020 semester. The University will be taking a hybrid approach to returning to campus, with part in-person teaching and part online classes.

The CIS Department, CG@Penn, and CIS 565 team are looking into the best method of instruction and projects for CIS 565. The course will remain programming projects intensive with lecture to support those projects.

CIS 565 will have at least a component of remote lectures, whether that is fully online, or a hybrid of in-class lecture that are streamed/uploaded for our students who cannot attend in-person.

Given the challenges this presents, we will be **enforcing a mandatory course prerequisite of CIS 460/560 or CIS 461/561**. If you have taken a similar computer graphics course, or have professional experience, we will consider that as a valid alternative. Please use the survey below to mark your qualification.

If you are interested in taking the course but do not have the prerequisites completed, please reach out to [Shehzan Mohammed](mailto:mza@seas.upenn.edu). We have to let you know that the course is very graphics and programming intensive and you will find it challenging without a graphics background, especially given that lectures and office hours will be remote.

If you have registered for the course, or plan to, please complete this **required survey: [CIS 565 Fall 2020 Student Survey](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=DQSIkWdsW0yxEjajBLZtrQAAAAAAAAAAAAMAALDIch9UNFhVQ1hTREZEWUIzVkpDUk83VkNPVU5MRy4u){:target="_blank"}**.

## Prerequisites

* Passion for computer graphics.
* At least one of:
  * **[CIS 460/560](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis460/current/){:target="_blank"}: Introduction to Computer Graphics.**
  * **CIS 461/561: Advance Rendering**
  * Preferably received an A. Knowledge of rasterization and ray tracing.
* Strong C or C++.
* Also useful:
  * [CIS 371](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis371/18sp/): Digital Systems Organization and Design, or
  * [CIS 501](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis501/): Introduction to Computer Architecture.

## Academic Integrity

An academic integrity violation will result in the student receiving an F in this course.

See [Academic Integrity at the University of Pennsylvania: A Guide for Students](http://www.upenn.edu/academicintegrity/){:target="_blank"}.

**Code submissions will be cross-checked for plaigarism against previous years' submissions as well as submissions from your colleagues using automated software. <u>Please do not copy code.</u>**

If you would like to use code not written by you for this class, please run it by the TAs using Piazza for permission to use it. Examples of code you will need to ask permission to use:

* Public Github Repositories and other open source projects.
* Projects from other classes that will give you a non-trivial advantage for the project.

If you think you need to ask permission, you should ask. We will most likely approve all reasonable requests.
