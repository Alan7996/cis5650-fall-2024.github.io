## Course Description

A timeline section from the following topics:

* **GPU Computing**: GPU architecture, massively parallel programming, parallel algorithms, performance.
* **Rendering**: Graphics pipeline (rasterization), path tracing, deferred shading, forward+ rendering, VR.
* **APIs**: CUDA, WebGL, RTX, Vulkan.

This is a project-intensive course with significant coding, writing, and presenting. It is **more work** than any other course, but it is worth it.

For a course more focused on GPU architecture without graphics, see Joe Devietti's [CIS 601](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~devietti/classes/cis601-spring2017/){:target="_blank"} (no longer offered at Penn).

**If you have registered as a student for the course, or plan to, please complete this required survey: [CIS 565 Fall 2021 Student Survey](https://forms.office.com/r/Eh3U0WwP12){:target="_blank"}**.

## Academic Integrity

An academic integrity violation will result in the student receiving an F in this course.

See [Academic Integrity at the University of Pennsylvania: A Guide for Students](http://www.upenn.edu/academicintegrity/){:target="_blank"}.

**Code submissions will be cross-checked for plaigarism against previous years' submissions as well as submissions from your colleagues using automated software. <u>Please do not copy code.</u>**

If you would like to use code not written by you for this class, please run it by the TAs using Piazza for permission to use it. Examples of code you will need to ask permission to use:

* Public Github Repositories and other open source projects.
* Projects from other classes that will give you a non-trivial advantage for the project.

If you think you need to ask permission, you should ask. We will most likely approve all reasonable requests.

## Penn Engineering COVID-19 Impact and Announcements

Please visit the [COVID-19](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/coronavirus/) for information on Penn Engineering's announcements and information about COVID-19 impact and procedures.

### COVID Protocols for CIS 565

* Classrooms will be operating under normal, pre-COVID capacity during the Fall 2021 term.
* CIS 565 will be in person and lecture recordings will be made available within 24 hours after the lecture.
* In accordance with University policy, **students are required wear a face mask in the classroom and to all in-person office hours**. Students who do not wear a mask in class may be required to leave the classroom.
  * As a consequence of this requirement, please keep eating and drinking within the classroom to a minimum.
* If a student (or staff) tests positive at any point during the semester, and there is probable risk of spread, a portion of the students, if not the entire class may be moved online-only temporarily. You will be notified through Piazza.
